#What?

An idea for an introductory data structures assignment to implement an enigma machine. This will aim to introduce and reinforce concepts of circular linked lists.

#How? What's assigned?

We have a python prototype for testing. We will include some Java implementations of the assignment as well.

We hope to assign the following:
- An encoder to encode "German" messages. Schnell!
  - There will be a "create rotor" to make a rotor.
  - There will be an encode.
- A Bombe machine to decrypt all the things! (Turing!!!)
- Perhaps a checker function. We will have to research the 1940s implementation.

#Why this assignment?

We believe that data structures (among introductory classes), should have projects that help people learn not only the content but some CS geekiness.
